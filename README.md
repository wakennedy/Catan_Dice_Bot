### CATAN DICE ROLL BOT

This mess of code is a dice rolling bot for the board game "Settlers of Catan".

User can set the order of players by name, change a players name, and roll the dice.

Dice rolls are created by sampling an array of numbers 1-6 and combining those samples 
    to create a realistic probability of roll outcomes. 

When the 'stop' command is given, the bot will report how many times each player rolled 
    each number. As well as the top 3 numbers that were rolled by the entire player group.
